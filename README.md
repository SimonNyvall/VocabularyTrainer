# Vocabulary Trainer

This is a project we got assigned at ITHS, where the goal is to build a console and a forms app to train your vocabulary. The program should support n number of languages and use the same class across the console and form program. The Word class consists of a string array with the translations, and two indexes FromLanguage andToLanguage. FromLanguage and ToLanguage is for the user so they know what languages they should translate from and to. The WordList class contains methods to do operations on an array with type Word.

**List Wordlist** lists all Word Lists. By clicking on a list will bring up a list on the right side displaying the languages the list contains. It will also show the word count of that particular list. Hitting the 'Select' button will take the user to the edit page

**Edit Mode** is a page there the user can see the content of the WordList, but also add, remove and practice the selected list.
The list will be loaded into practice.

**Practice** mode will select a random word from the list and random languages which the word should be translated to and from. If the user answer is wrong the program will display the right answer at the bottom. Hitting the 'Restart' button will display how many percent the user got right and start the score over.
